# Shiny Application A/B Test Analysis Report

## Introduction & Research Question

This report presents the results of an A/B test conducted on our Shiny web application designed for data analysis tasks. The main objective was to determine whether an alternative UI design (Group B) could improve user engagement and task efficiency compared to the original design (Group A).

### Research Question

Does the alternative design (Group B) of our Shiny application lead to improved user engagement metrics and task completion rates compared to the original design (Group A)?

### Hypotheses

- **H0 (Null Hypothesis)**: There are no significant differences in user engagement and task completion metrics between the original (A) and alternative (B) designs.
- **H1 (Alternative Hypothesis)**: The alternative design (B) shows statistically significant improvements in user engagement and task completion metrics compared to the original design (A).

## Experimental Design & Methodology

### Experiment Setup

We designed a controlled experiment where users were randomly assigned to either Group A (original design) or Group B (alternative design) when accessing the Shiny application. The assignment was managed through URL parameters, ensuring that users would consistently see the same version of the application.

### Key Design Differences

The primary differences between the two designs included:

1. **Visual Design Changes**:
   - Color scheme: Group A used a blue-based theme, while Group B featured a high-contrast theme
   - Button placement: Group B had more prominent button positions
   - Layout structure: Group B implemented a cleaner, more streamlined layout

2. **Feature Modifications**:
   - Navigation: Group B featured a simplified, more intuitive navigation flow
   - Interactive elements: Group B included improved tooltips and interactive elements

3. **Content Adjustment**:
   - Instructional text: Group B had more concise and clearer instructions
   - Feedback messages: Group B provided more immediate visual feedback for user actions

### Metrics

We measured several key performance indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of each design:

1. **Engagement Metrics**:
   - Button click rate
   - Plot interactions
   - Scroll activity
   - Module navigation depth

2. **Time-Based Metrics**:
   - Time spent in different sections (data upload, data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis)
   - Total time spent in the application
   - Interaction latency

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - Task completion rate
   - Download interaction rate
   - Number of preprocessing ac
